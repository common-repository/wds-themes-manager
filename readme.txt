- the plugin executes each filter one by one due to the order each of them was established.
You can add as many different filters as you wish, just keep in mind that the features of one filter shouldnít withstand with the features of the others.
WDS Themes Manager is currently available in a pilot version thatís why there still some things that need more time to be fixed. Our team considered necessary to inform about two things you should keep in your mind :
- different themes support different features. So when switching to a different theme from the current one you have, your website outlook may lose some features it used to have with the previous theme;
- your filters shouldnít withstand with each other. For example, if in your filter you excluded mobile phones, you canít further, for example, include some models of mobile phones applicable to the same theme.
